      Your donations allow the NFF to support activities like the NFU Youth
      Retreat and the newly released podcast, “<a href="https://sowandgrow.ca/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sow and Grow</a>.” Both urban and rural
      communities benefit from the education, activism, and momentum these
      projects create as the next generation of farm leadership builds its
      capacity and networks.
